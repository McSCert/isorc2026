ISORC has become established as the leading event devoted to state-of-the-art research in the field of object/component/service-oriented real-time distributed computing (ORC) technology that consider one or more ilities, such as performance, dependability, scalability, among others.

This year's theme is **TBA**.

For our 29th symposium, we are meeting in Hamilton, The Waterfall capital of the World. Located in Ontario (Canada) on the Niagara escarpment, McMaster University will host this edition from May 27 - 29, 2026.

- Camera-ready papers: March 20, 2026
- Early registration for authors: March 20, 2026


### Main Theme and Topics

We solicit high-quality papers pertaining to all aspects of ORC technology, that consider one or more ilities, such as performance, dependability, scalability, among others and those that are well aligned with the 2025 theme. Authors are encouraged to consider submissions with a practical orientation and validation related to Case Studies & Applications in this area. The specific ORC focus areas include, but are not limited to:

- TBA


### Guidelines for Manuscripts

ISORC 2026 invites papers in three categories. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three Program Committee members according to a single-blind review process. Submission guidelines for each category of paper are as follows:

- **Regular Research Papers**: Papers should describe original work and papers submitted for review should be a maximum of 10 pages in length, using the IEEE conference paper format. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers.

- **Industrial Papers and Practitioner Reports**: Papers describing experiences of using ORC technology in application or tool development projects, are an integral part of the technical program of ISORC. These papers should be no longer than 10 pages, using the IEEE conference paper format and may be less formal than research papers. A maximum of two extra pages may be purchased during the camera-ready submission of accepted papers.  
  - They should clearly identify and discuss in detail the issues that represent notable industrial advances. Reports with project metrics supporting their claims are particularly sought, as well as those that show both benefits and drawbacks of the approaches used in the given project.

- **Short Papers**: Short research papers that are no longer than 6 pages, using the IEEE conference paper format, on real-time analytics are also invited, and should contain enough information for the program committee to understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or approach.
