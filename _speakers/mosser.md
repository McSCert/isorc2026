Dr Sébastien Mosser is an Associate Professor of Software Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at McMaster University and a licensed Professional Engineer (PEng) in Ontario.  He is a proud member of the McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert) and leads research that bridges rigorous safety-thinking with everyday software development. 


He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from Université de Nice in 2010, then worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Inria Lille‑Nord Europe and as a research scientist at SINTEF in Norway before holding professorial positions in Europe and Canada. 

Prof. Mosser’s main research focus is the design of domain-specific languages and modelling techniques—for example, the project jPipe, a language for justification diagrams—which help software engineers reason about fairness, safety, and ethical aspects even in non-safety-critical applications such as mental-health journaling apps. 

Outside of academia, he is a self-described “Geek, Snowboarder, and composition driven guy” (order may vary) who brings humor and human-scale insight into his teaching and research.
